A simple mobile-first responsive resume page, Created as a part of [p1xt's "Web development with computer science foundations" guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/wd-cs.md), this is my very first time following the "mobile-first" approach and trying to create a responsive page without using any CSS framework, the [resume design](https://creativemarket.com/ikonome/686585-Material-Resume-Blue/screenshots/#screenshot2) is made by ikono.me team.
